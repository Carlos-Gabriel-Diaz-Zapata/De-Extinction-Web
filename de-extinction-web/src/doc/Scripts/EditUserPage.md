## EditUserPage

The `EditUserPage` component allows editing an existing user's details. It fetches the user's current data, allows the admin to update it, and submit the changes.

## Description

The `EditUserPage` component is a functional React component that provides a form for admin users to edit an existing user's details. It includes fields for the user's name, email, and password, and handles form submission to update the user's information through an API.

## Class Structure

- **`EditUserPage` component**:
  - Main method: `EditUserPage`
  - State:
    - `name`: Stores the user's name.
    - `email`: Stores the user's email.
    - `password`: Stores the user's password.
  - Methods:
    - `fetchUser`: Fetches the user's data from the API and updates the state.
    - `handleSubmit`: Handles the form submission to update the user's details.

## Main Logic

**Rendering Logic (`EditUserPage` component)**:
  - The component initializes states `name`, `email`, and `password` to manage the form inputs.
  - The `useEffect` hook fetches the user's data from the API when the component mounts and updates the state.
  - The `handleSubmit` function handles form submission, calls the API service to update the user's details, and navigates to the admin page upon success or shows error notifications.
  - The component renders the header, a form to edit the user's details, and a toast container for notifications.
