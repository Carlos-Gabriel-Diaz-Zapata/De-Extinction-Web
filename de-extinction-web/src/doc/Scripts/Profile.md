## Profile

The `Profile` component displays the user's profile information, including their email, username, and password.

## Description

The `Profile` component is a functional React component that shows the authenticated user's profile information. If no user is authenticated, it displays a message indicating that the user is not authenticated.

## Class Structure

- **`Profile` component**:
  - Main method: `Profile`
  - Methods:
    - `if (!user)`: Checks if the user is authenticated. If not, displays a message.

## Main Logic

**Rendering Logic (`Profile` component)**:
  - The component accesses the `user` from the `AuthContext`.
  - If no user is authenticated, it returns a message indicating the user is not authenticated.
  - If a user is authenticated, it renders the header, and a form to display the user's email, username, and password.

## External Dependencies

- **React**: The component uses React for building the user interface.
  - `import React, { useContext } from "react";`: This import is necessary to use React and the `useContext` hook.
- **AuthContext**: This context provides information about the authenticated user.
  - `import { AuthContext } from "../context/AuthContext";`: This import is necessary to access the authentication context.
- **CSS**: The component uses an external CSS file for styling the profile page.
  - `import "../Page/Css/Profile.css";`: This import is necessary to apply styles to the profile page.
